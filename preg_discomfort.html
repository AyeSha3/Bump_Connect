		<p>Symptoms of discomfort due to pregnancy vary from woman-to-woman. The following are some common discomforts. However, each mother-to-be may experience symptoms differently or not at all:</p> 

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Nausea and Vomiting</p></b>
		<p>About half of all pregnant women experience nausea and sometimes vomiting in the first trimester, also called morning sickness because symptoms are most severe in the morning. Some women may have nausea and vomiting throughout the pregnancy. Morning sickness may be due to the changes in hormone levels during pregnancy.

		Morning sickness seems to be aggravated by stress, traveling, and certain foods, such as spicy or fatty foods. Eating small meals several times a day may help lessen the symptoms. A diet high in protein and complex carbohydrates (such as whole wheat bread, pasta, bananas, and green, leafy vegetables) may also help reduce the severity of the nausea.

		If vomiting is severe, causing a woman to lose fluids and weight, it may indicate a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyperemesis can lead to dehydration and may require hospitalization for intravenous fluids and nutrition. Call your physician or midwife if you are having constant or severe nausea and vomiting.</p>

		<b><p style= "color:#8A8913">Fatigue</p></b>
		<p>As the body works overtime to provide a nourishing environment for the fetus, it is no wonder a pregnant woman often feels tired. In the first trimester, her blood volume and other fluids increase as her body adjusts to the pregnancy. Sometimes anemia is the underlying cause of the fatigue. Anemia is a reduction in the oxygen-carrying capability of red blood cells, and is usually due to low iron levels. A simple blood test performed at a prenatal visit will check for anemia.</p>

		<b><p style= "color:#8A8913">Back Pain</p></b>
		<p>During a healthy pregnancy, women typically gain between 25 and 35 pounds. The spine has to support that weight. That cause lower back pain. The weight of the growing baby and uterus also put pressure on the blood vessels and nerves in the pelvis and back.</p>
	
		<b><p style= "color:#8A8913">Constipation</p></b>
		<p>Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy. As many as half of pregnant wowmen get constipated at some point. One culprit is an increase in the hormone progesterone, which relaxes smooth muscles throughout the body, including the digestive tract. This means that food passes through the intestine more slowly.</p>

		<b><p style= "color:#8A8913">Swelling/Fluid Retention </p></b>
		<p>Mild swelling is common during pregnancy but severe swelling that persists may indicate preeclampsia (abnormal condition marked by high blood pressure). Lying on the left side, elevating the legs, and wearing support hose and comfortable shoes may help to relieve the swelling. Be sure to notify your physician or midwife about sudden swelling, especially in the hands or face, or rapid weight gain</p>

		<b><p style= "color:#8A8913">Stretch marks </p></b>
		<p>Pinkish stretch marks may appear on the abdomen, breasts, thighs, or buttocks. Stretch marks are generally caused by a rapid increase in weight, and the marks usually fade after pregnancy.</p>

		<b><p style= "color:#8A8913">Congested or Bloody Nose </p></b>
		<p>During pregnancy, the lining of the respiratory tract receives more blood, often making it more congested. This congestion can also cause stuffiness in the nose or nosebleeds. In addition, small blood vessels in the nose are easily damaged due to the increased blood volume, causing nosebleeds.</p>

		<b><p style= "color:#8A8913">Shortness of Breath</p></b>
		<p>In the last trimester of pregnancy, your growing baby pushes your uterus against your diaphragm(the muscle under your lungs that contracts and relaxes in the breathing cycle). The diaphragm is moved up about 4 cm from its pre-pregnancy position. Your lungs are also somewhat compressed.</p>
