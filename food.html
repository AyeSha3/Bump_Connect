		<p>What a woman eats and drinks during pregnancy is her baby's main source of nourishment. The type of diet we encourage during pregnancy refers to fine-tuning your eating habits to ensure you are receiving adequate nutrition for the health of you and your baby. Healthy eating during pregnancy is critical to your baby’s growth and development.</p> 
		<p>In order to get the nutrients you need, you must eat from a variety of food groups, including fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, protein sources and dairy products.Typically, you will need to consume an extra 300 calories a day.</p>

  	<blockquote style= "color:#B1B034; font-family: Courier New; font-size:70%">
		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Dairy Products</p></b>
		<p>During pregnancy, you need to consume extra protein and calcium to meet the needs of the growing fetus. Dairy products contain two types of high quality protein: casein and whey. Dairy is the best dietary source of calcium, and provides high amounts of phosphorus, various B-vitamins, magnesium and zinc.</p>

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Sweet Potatoes</p></b>
		<p>Sweet potatoes are very rich in beta-carotene, a plant compound that is converted into vitamin A in the body. Vitamin A is essential for growth, as well as for the differentiation of most cells and tissues. It is very important for healthy fetal development. Pregnant women are generally advised to increase their vitamin A intake by 10–40%.</p>

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Salmon</p></b>
		<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are essential during pregnancy, especially the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA. These are found in high amounts in seafood, and help build the brain and eyes of the fetus.</p>

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Broccoli and dark, leafy greens</p></b>
		<p>Broccoli and dark, green vegetables, such as kale and spinach, contain many of the nutrients that pregnant women need. These include fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin A, calcium, iron, folate and potassium. Furthermore, broccoli and leafy greens are rich in antioxidants. They also contain plant compounds that benefit the immune system and digestion. Due to their high fiber content, these vegetables may also help prevent constipation.</p>

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Water</p></b>
		<p>During pregnancy, blood volume increases by up to 1.5 liters. Therefore, it is important to stay properly hydrated. The fetus usually gets everything it needs, but if you don’t watch your water intake, you may become dehydrated. Furthermore, increasing water intake may help relieve constipation and reduce the risk of urinary tract infections, which are common during pregnancy.</p>

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Fish with Mercury</p></b>
		<p>Fish that contain high levels of mercury should be avoided. Mercury consumed during pregnancy has been linked to developmental delays and brain damage. A sample of these types of fish includes: shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish.</p>

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Alcohol</p></b>
		<p>There is NO amount of alcohol that is known to be safe during pregnancy, and therefore alcohol should be avoided during pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to alcohol can interfere with the healthy development of the baby. Depending on the amount, timing, and pattern of use, alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or other developmental disorders.</p>

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Raw  Eggs</p></b>
		<p>Raw eggs can be contaminated with Salmonella. Symptoms of Salmonella infections are usually experienced only by the mother. They include fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhea.However, in rare cases, the infection may cause cramps in the uterus, leading to premature birth or stillbirth. Foods that commonly contain raw eggs include: Poached eggs, Homemade mayonnaise, Salad dressings and Homemade ice cream.</p>

		<b><p  style= "color:#8A8913">Caffeine</p></b>
		<p>Pregnant women are generally advised to limit their caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day, or about 2–3 cups of coffee. Caffeine is absorbed very quickly, and passes easily into the placenta and fetus. High caffeine intake during pregnancy has been shown to restrict fetal growth and increase the risk of low birth weight at delivery. Low birth weight, defined as less than 2.5 kg, is associated with an increased risk of infant death and a higher risk of chronic diseases in adulthood, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p>
